Writing Organised CSS - Section 5, Lecture 13
1. File architecture
2. Identify patterns in design
3. Rules to follow for creating class names and writing our CSS selectors.

B.E.M Principles
Popular abstract way of thinking about our interface.
Block - an independent, reusable part of our design.
Element - belongs to a block.  It cannot be used outside of the block that it belongs to.
Modifier - can be used on a block or an element to indicate a change to the default state of an object.

- CSS selectors should target elements directory with classes, instead of relying on type selectors, 
	descendent selectors, and the cascade.
- Because we are limiting cascade we are free to move blocks around and reuse them throughout the page.
- Blocks can be nested inside other blocks.
- Identify patterns, and then create single-responsibility blocks.
- Makes the relationship between our HTML and CSS clear.

There is no need to code a pattern more than once.
